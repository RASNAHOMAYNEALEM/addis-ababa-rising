# Addis Ababa Rising: Kazanchis Testimony, Resistance & Rebuilding

**Addis Ababa Rising** is the official digital archive, public campaign, and rebuilding initiative led by Ras Nahom Aynealem — heir to the broken heart of Kazanchis.

This site documents the **forced displacement**, **cultural destruction**, and **crimes against humanity** committed under the so-called “Corridor Development” project. It also uplifts the legacy of the lost and envisions a just, dignified rebirth for all those driven from their homes.

- Demand justice, international action, and accountability from the Ethiopian government
- Resurrect Kazanchis and beyond — with eco-friendly, heritage-rooted housing plans like *Felige Asfeligie*, *Imru Heights*, and *Tasié Corner*
- Create a testimony-driven platform for survivors to speak, archive, organize, and rebuild
