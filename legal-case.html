      <h2>The Foundation of Our Case</h2>
      <p>On Meskerem 21, 2016 (September 28, 2023), under the guise of the so-called ‚ÄúCorridor Development‚Äù project, hundreds of families in Kazanchis were forcibly displaced, their homes demolished with no compensation, no resettlement, no court hearing, and no dignity. Since then, the violence has spread across Addis Ababa, displacing thousands more in places like Mexico, Piassa, Arat Kilo, and beyond.</p>
      <p>We are documenting these abuses, backed by evidence: videos, photographs, news clips, eyewitness testimony, and the names and faces of the victims. This is a case of cultural erasure, state violence, and crimes against humanity. It demands legal action, national reflection, and international attention.</p>
