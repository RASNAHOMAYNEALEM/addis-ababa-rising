        <h3>“Human Sacrifices” — Ras Nahom</h3>
        <blockquote>
          our mothers and fathers, history, legacy and memories.. ,<br/>
          our toughts, honor, ideas, love, fire and hope.
          demolished, desteroyed n Scrubbed..  <br/>
          why are we fighting? what are we living for?
          why have so many died for us? For what? For this? weaponised hunger and bulldozed dreams?<br/>
          They tore our roofs while we still screamed
