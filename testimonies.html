        <h3>“Human Sacrifices” — Ras Nahom</h3>
        <blockquote>
          our mothers and fathers..<br/> 
          history, legacy and memories,<br/>
          our toughts, honor, ideas, love, fire and hope<br/>
          demolished, destroyed n Scrubbed..  <br/>
          are we not Humans? or is there an unfavored type?<br/>
          are we not ETHIOPIANS? or are Ethiopians no more welcome in Ethiopia?<br/>
          what are we fighting? what are we fighting for?<br/>
          is whatever it is worth us?<br/>
          why are we still dying after so many died for us?<br/> 
          if we are not living right<br/>
          why were our lovers sacrificed?<br/>
          For what? For this?<br/> 
          forceful evictions? persecutions? 
          weaponised hunger and bulldozed dreams?<br/>
          They tore our roofs while we cried and screamed<br/>
          but we will not be erased we are returning.<br/>
          and justice is coming with us.<br/>
