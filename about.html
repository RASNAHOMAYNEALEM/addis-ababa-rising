      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>
        Kazanchis Rising is a grassroots movement and archive dedicated to preserving the memory, dignity,
        and dreams of the communities displaced from Addis Ababa under so-called development. We are architects
        of return, truth-tellers, and builders of justice.

      <h2>Who We Are</h2>
      <p>
        We are survivors, witnesses, children of Kazanchis and other erased neighborhoods. Our families were 
        displaced, our homes demolished, our rights ignored. But we rise — not only to remember, but to rebuild.

      <h2>What We Do</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Collect testimonies and evidence of forced displacement</li>
        <li>Publish legal documents and advocacy reports</li>
        <li>Design future housing and restoration projects</li>
        <li>Mobilize global solidarity and diaspora action</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
      <p>
        Our city is not for sale. Our heritage is not disposable. When they destroyed Kazanchis, they tried 
        to destroy memory. This site is our refusal — a record, a rebellion, and a rebirth.
