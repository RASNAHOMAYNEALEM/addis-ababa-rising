      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>
        Kazanchis Rising is a grassroots movement led by displaced residents and their descendants seeking justice, restoration, and dignity. 
        We are survivors of forced demolitions and cultural erasure, standing together to reclaim our homes, preserve our heritage, and rebuild Addis Ababa with truth and memory at its core.
      </p>

      <h2>Who We Are</h2>
      <p>
        We are children of Kazanchis and Addis Ababa — archivists, activists, architects, artists, mothers, fighters. 
        Our roots are deep, and our vision is bold. We remember the homes built by Fitawrari Desalegn, the voices of Tilahun Gessesse, the spirit of Ras Imru, the community of Grazmach Tasie, and the countless unnamed lives erased in the name of "development."
      </p>

      <h2>What We Do</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Document testimonies of survivors and victims</li>
        <li>Launch legal action against human rights violations</li>
        <li>Rebuild our homes with eco-friendly, heritage-based housing plans</li>
        <li>Educate the public through archives, exhibits, and events</li>
        <li>Connect survivors, activists, and supporters globally</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Join Us</h2>
      <p>
        Whether you are from Kazanchis, Addis Ababa, or anywhere in the world — if you believe in justice, truth, and people over profit — this movement is for you. We rise not as victims but as visionaries. Welcome home.
