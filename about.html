      <p>
        I was born from the smoke and prayers of Kazanchis — raised by women who built cities as housemaids,
        men who fed us with dignity despite being exiled in their own land.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are not victims. We are descendants of lions. This archive is not nostalgia. It is resurrection.
        The land remembers. And so must the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        We will rebuild every home. Revive every melody. Restore every street.
        This is the age of return.
      </p>
