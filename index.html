      <h2>Kazanchis: Where Memory Refuses to Die</h2>
      <p>This campaign is a living memorial. A resurrection. A justice call for those who built Addis Ababa with stone, song, sacrifice — only to be displaced. We remember. We rebuild.</p>

      <h3>They Built Homes, Not Just Houses</h3>
      <div class="home-card">
        <h4>🏛 Fitawrari Desalegn's Stone Legacy</h4>
        <p>His home stood like a fortress in Kazanchis — carved in stone, passed through generations. They destroyed it. We will rebuild it in his name.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="home-card">
        <h4>🎶 Tilahun Gessese’s "Felige Asfeligie"</h4>
        <p>The song was written in that home. His voice echoed through Libefana alleyways. They erased his street, but not his sound. His house rises again.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="home-card">
        <h4>🏠 Grazmach Tasie's Menelik-Era House</h4>
        <p>It became a restaurant where history breathed. A Menelik-style architectural gem, later flattened. But we remember every brick — and will rebuild every line.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="home-card">
        <h4>🛡 Ras Imru Haile Selassie’s Post-Italian Victory Home</h4>
        <p>In that humble structure, dignity returned after fascist invasion. The Prosperity Party erased it — but its spirit is eternal. Imru Heights will rise.</p>
      </div>

    <section class="vision">
      <h3>Our Vision</h3>
      <p>We will reconstruct homes for the displaced. Apartments that honor heritage. Eco-smart, stone-strong, and community-rooted. Every project is a testimony. Every block says: <strong>Never Again.</strong></p>
    </section>

    <section class="call">
      <h3>Be Part of the Resurrection</h3>
      <p>This is not nostalgia. It’s justice. Help us resettle survivors. Help us name buildings after our ancestors. Sign. Share. Testify. Rise.</p>
